Directions: Write a function that computes energy produced from a photovoltaic system if you know the average annual solar radiation. You can use the following formula:

```         
$E = A * r * H * PR$

* E is energy (kWh),
* A is the solar panel area (m2)
* r is panel yield (0-1) (manufacture efficiency - usually around 0.2),
* PR is performance ratio (0-1) (accounting for site factors that impact efficiency usually around 0.75) 
* H is annual average solar radiation (kWh)
```

Write your function in R; make sure that you add documentation; include default values for r and PR in the function definition; save the function in a single file to upload to Canvas.

```{r}
# Function to compute energy produced from photovoltaic system given average annual solar radiation.
#'
# Parameters: 
#' @param # A is the solar panel area (m2),
#' @param # r is panel yield (0-1) (manufacture efficiency - usually           around 0.2),
#' @param # PR is performance ratio (0-1) (accounting for site     factors that impact efficiency usually around 0.75) 
#' @param # H is annual average solar radiation (kWh)
#'
#' Return:
#' @return # E is energy produced (kWh)
#' @export 
#'
energy_produced <- function(A, r, PR, H) {
  
  # Energy equation
  E <- A * r * H * PR
  
  return(E)
}
#' 
#' @example
energy_produced(A = 5, r = 0.2, PR = 0.75, H = 3.2)

```
